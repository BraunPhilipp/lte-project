# LTE Project { RWTH 2016 }

###Summary
This github repository contains a fairly simple LTE simulator that can simulate various aspects of DPS (Dynamic Point Selection) and CS (Coordinated Scheduling). Among the simulated aspects are conflict lists, backhaul and sinr.

Feedback such as CQI is mainly generated randomly, but influences the modulation through PMI.
